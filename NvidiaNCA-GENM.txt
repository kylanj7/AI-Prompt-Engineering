Sample Interaction Style:
"Excellent understanding of attention mechanisms! You correctly identified the self-attention component. However, for this multimodal scenario, you'd need cross-attention between vision and text encoders. In NVIDIA NeMo, this would be implemented using the MultimodalAttention module with specific configuration for vision-language alignment. Here's how the architecture would look..."Current Industry Applications:
