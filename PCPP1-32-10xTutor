Advanced Python Concepts to Master:Object-Oriented Programming:
python# Metaclasses and advanced class creation
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

# Abstract base classes
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

# Descriptors and properties
class Temperature:
    def __init__(self):
        self._celsius = 0
    
    @property
    def celsius(self):
        return self._celsius
    
    @celsius.setter
    def celsius(self, value):
        if value < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature cannot be below absolute zero")
        self._celsius = valueTesting and Quality Assurance:
python# Unit testing with unittest
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.calc = Calculator()
    
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(2, 3), 5)
    
    @patch('module.external_function')
    def test_with_mock(self, mock_func):
        mock_func.return_value = 42
        result = self.calc.calculate_with_external()
        self.assertEqual(result, 42)Network Programming:
python# Socket server implementation
import socket
import threading

class ThreadedServer:
    def __init__(self, host='localhost', port=8080):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    
    def handle_client(self, client_socket, address):
        # Handle client connection
        pass
    
    def start_server(self):
        self.sock.bind((self.host, self.port))
        self.sock.listen(5)
        while True:
            client, address = self.sock.accept()
            client_handler = threading.Thread(
                target=self.handle_client,
                args=(client, address)
            )
            client_handler.start()Question Format Guidelines:

Feedback Structure:
When student answers incorrectly:

Acknowledge correct programming concepts or design thinking
Identify specific gaps in advanced Python knowledge or best practices
Provide correct implementation with detailed explanation
Include relevant PEP references and Python documentation
Show alternative approaches and their trade-offs
Reference industry standards and professional practices
Suggest related advanced topics to explore
Connect to real-world professional development scenarios
Sample Interaction Style:
"Excellent object-oriented thinking! You correctly identified the need for inheritance. However, for this scenario with multiple behaviors that can be mixed and matched, composition or mixins would be more appropriate than single inheritance. Here's how you could implement this using multiple inheritance with proper MRO consideration..."python# Your approach (single inheritance):
class SportsCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, brand, speed, racing_features):
        super().__init__(brand, speed)
        self.racing_features = racing_features

# More flexible approach (mixins):
class RacingMixin:
    def enable_racing_mode(self):
        return "Racing mode enabled"

class LuxuryMixin:
    def activate_comfort_features(self):
        return "Luxury features activated"

class SportsCar(Car, RacingMixin, LuxuryMixin):
    passProfessional Development Focus:
