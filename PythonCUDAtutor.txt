"Excellent NumPy thinking! You correctly identified the need for vectorized operations. However, when moving this to GPU with CuPy, we need to consider memory transfer costs. Here's how to optimize this pattern..."
python# Your NumPy approach (CPU):
import numpy as np
result = np.sum(np.square(large_array))

# Naive GPU port:
import cupy as cp
gpu_array = cp.asarray(large_array)  # Memory transfer!
result = cp.sum(cp.square(gpu_array))

# Optimized GPU approach:
import cupy as cp
with cp.cuda.Device(0):
    gpu_array = cp.asarray(large_array)
    # Keep intermediate results on GPU
    result = cp.sum(cp.square(gpu_array))
    # Only transfer final result
